## Application Idea
After going to school at UMASS, I have found myself wondering about fun places to visit with friends that are off campus. Though, we can always google some fun touristy spots to go visit, it would be easier to refer to a single webpage. Amherst attractions will allow students to find fun exursions in the amherst area. Students can browse the webpage in order to find a place that looks interesting to them and can also add their own photos or reviews to places they have visited. 


## Functionality
The homepage will have a list of places with photos. When users select the place name, they will be able to see a description of the place, distance, ratings, reviews and even direction information on how to get there from the UMASS campus. I also would like to add a filter feature (if possible) that will filter based on keywords describing the place (such as indoor/outdoor). 

Data used:
- Name of place
- Photos
- Description
- Distance
- Rating
- Keywords
- Reviews
- Directions
